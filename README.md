Spelling application for students

Creates activities that can be done on the computer or printed for later use. Original ran on old Mac using Hypercard. 
New goal would be to have this run as an app on tablet or website.  We need to discuss this further.  
I would also like there to be an ability to print some offline (paper/pencil) activities.  


To see original hypercard version download both the miniVmac emulator and the hfs30M.dsk image in a compressed archive from here:

If you already have miniVmac emulator then just download prototype disk image at:

If minivac emulator fails to work, try using newer version from here (Windows, Linux, Macand other OS'es)

Drag and drop DSK file onto mini vmac emulator and it should start.  CTRL key acts as option key for Linux/Windows.
